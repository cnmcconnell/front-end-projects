JAVASCRIPT:

The two instances of JavaScript being used include the navigation in the upper right hand corner, and the cycling of images in the CTA found on the homepage.

The scripts can be found at the bottom of the body. The nav will be on every page, whereas the CTA scripting will be found only on the homepage. 

Navigation script executes a drop down menu, in which the user can access other pages on the site.
CTA script executes a three image slide show, transitioning with a fade, using opacity. 


MULTIMEDIA:

The multimedia element can be found on the "Product2.htm" page. This is the specific product page for the Intel Gaming Computer, which can be accessed through clicking the "See More..." on the Products page, under that item. The element is a gameplay video example which uses the same graphics card as that computer.


OTHER INTERESTING NOTES:

-Products page includes a "see more..." option which brings the user to an individual page, detailing the selected product. This individual page also includes a link to return to the original products page, and a review snippet that includes another "see more..." option, taking the user to the Reviews page. The bottom of this page provides a link to the Consultation page, in case the user needs asistance.

-Underneath each name on the Reviews page is the name of the product being reviewed, which is a link to the specific product's page.

-My apologies for going one page over 10, but since it was the only way I could think of instead of modifying the php file (which I have no clue how to do lol) and using JavaScript, I linked the submit buttons on both forms to reload the same page with an additional confirmation message at the bottom, notifying the user that their submission had been received. Also note that if the user were to submit ANOTHER form from the same Confirmation page (say they have another question or review) they are able.
